        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I’m an aspiring web developer who is looking to make the leap into the
          ever evolving field of tech. I'm from West Philadelphia, born and
          raised. On the playground is where I spent most of my days. While I
          call Philadelphia my home, I've also had the opportunity to travel the
          world. With a lot of grit and hard work, I was able to excel in my
          previous career in logistics and travel the world while taking in the
          vast cultures of places that were very foreign to me. I’m looking to
          embrace this career change and bring my life experience to the process
          of building beautiful looking websites and applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve worked in logistics for over 10 years and am a life-long learner
          who's always aspiring to expand my skill set.
